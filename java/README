  The Compact in Java

  The javaTree directory uses a simple Tree.java class, similar to the C's
  Node.c union, but instead all possible branches are present, although
  some elements may not be in use.
  Selection is performed by i386j.brg pburg file.

  The javaNode directory uses a Node.java class and it's subclasses to
  provide an Object-Oriented replacement for the C's union.
  Selection is performed by i386j.brg pburg file.

  The javaVisitor directory uses a Node.java class and it's subclasses to
  Simple hierarchy of Node types to replace C's union.
  The code generation is performed by Visitor pattern transversing which
  requires additional node types since a different NodeXXX.java class for
  each distinct generation pattern.
  Since no selection is performed each Visitor's accept rotine can only
  generate its own code without interaction with other adjacent node,
  therefore no selection optimization can be performed.
